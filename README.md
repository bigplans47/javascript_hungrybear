This game uses a console log to count down a timer which is adapted to be the 'food level' of Fuzzy da Bear, a hungry bear with unending appetite

This program also uses a gulp file, bower and karma for testing.

How to play HungryBear:
git a clone
navigate to the home directory of this project in terminal
$npm install
$bower install
